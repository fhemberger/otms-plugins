Connected Projects: View Template
=================================

Version: 1.01 (2008-12-30)
Author:  Frederic Hemberger, mail[at]frederic-hemberger[dot]de

This plugin restores OTMS' built in "View Template" dialog for shared content
classes in SmartTree's Content Class menu menu.

This is third party software. The author is not affiliated in any manner with
RedDot Solutions AG or Open Text Corporation.

If you make modifications/improvements to this software, please drop me a mail,
so I can include it in future releases. Of cause, it would be also interesting
to hear, who uses this software. Feedback is always appreciated!



INSTALLATION
============

1. Copy ViewTemplate.xml to the RedDot CMS plug-in folder
   (/ASP/PlugIns).

2. Import the plugin in the ServerManager and activate it.

3. Enable plugin for your projects. This plugin is only useful in projects
   using shared content class folders from another project.
